# SystemVerilog FIFO Design with Testbench

This repository contains a **parameterized synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out)** design implemented in **SystemVerilog** along with its control and register file modules.  
It also includes a testbench to verify correct functionality under different read/write scenarios.
